# This file is used to configure the automounter
#

# The number of seconds after which an automounted file system will
# be unmounted if it hasn't been referred to within that period of
# time.  The default is 10 minutes (600 seconds).
# This is equivalent to the -t option in automount(8).
AUTOMOUNT_TIMEOUT=3600

# If TRUE, automount(8) will print more detailed
# information about the actions it takes.
# This is equivalent to the -v option to automount(8).
#AUTOMOUNT_VERBOSE=FALSE

# If TRUE, automountd(8) will log to syslogd(8) more
# detailed information about the actions it takes.
# This is equivalent to the -v option to automountd(8).
#AUTOMOUNTD_VERBOSE=FALSE

# If TRUE, automountd(8) will disable browsing of all maps.
# This is equivalent to the -n option to automountd(8).
#AUTOMOUNTD_NOBROWSE=FALSE

# The trace level for logging information about requests received
# by automountd(8) from autofs, processing done for those requests,
# and replies sent to autofs.  The default level of 0 causes no
# information to be logged; each higher value causes more information
# to be logged.  This controls the same trace level that the -T option
# to automountd(8) controls.
#AUTOMOUNTD_TRACE=0

# Mount options.
# A string containing a comma-separated list of mount options
# that will be applied, by default, to all mounts done by automountd(8).
# The options for a particular mount can override these options.
# This controls the same default mount options that the -o option to
# automountd(8) controls.
AUTOMOUNTD_MNTOPTS=nosuid,nodev

# Force nosuid
# If TRUE automountd will force all mounts to be "nosuid".
# The default will be "nosuid" and any "suid" mount option
# will be ignored.
AUTOMOUNTD_NOSUID=TRUE

# Environment variables.  The format is AUTOMOUNTD_ENV=ENV=value.
# There should be one line per environment variable to be set and
# there can be as many of these lines as are required.

#
# This file is read by man to configure the default manpath (also used
# when MANPATH contains an empty substring), and to indicate support for
# a given locale.  The following configuration variables are supported:
#
# MANCONFIG		config_file_glob
# MANPATH		manpath_element
# MANLOCALE		locale
#
# It is assumed that catdirs are equal to a mandir within a given manpath, i.e.,
# share/man/man1 => share/man/cat1.
#
# Every automatically generated MANPATH includes these fields
#
MANPATH	/usr/share/man
MANPATH	/usr/local/share/man
MANPATH	/usr/X11/man
MANPATH	/Library/Apple/usr/share/man
#
# Uncomment if you want to include one of these by default
#
# MANPATH	/opt/*/man
# MANPATH	/usr/lib/*/man
# MANPATH	/usr/share/*/man
# MANPATH	/usr/kerberos/man
#
# Useful paths - note that COL should not be defined when
# NROFF is defined as "groff -Tascii" or "groff -Tlatin1";
# not only is it superfluous, but it actually damages the output.
# For use with utf-8, NROFF should be "nroff -mandoc" without -T option.
# (Maybe - but today I need -Tlatin1 to prevent double conversion to utf8.)
#
# If you have a new troff (version 1.18.1?) and its colored output
# causes problems, add the -c option to TROFF, NROFF, JNROFF.
#
# Uncomment these if you have installed groff manually.  Note that man(1) will
# not provide defaults for any of these tools; their paths must be specified
# here, and we require absolute paths to make sure we use the correct tools.
#
# TROFF		/usr/local/bin/groff -Tps -mandoc -c
# NROFF		/usr/local/bin/groff -Wall -mtty-char -Tascii -mandoc -c
# EQN		/usr/local/bin/eqn -Tps
# TBL		/usr/local/bin/tbl
# REFER		/usr/local/bin/refer
# PIC		/usr/local/bin/pic

# The default MANPAGER is less(1), while the default WHATISPAGER for whatis and
# apropos remains more(1) for historical compatibility.  This can either
# be switched in the environment, or globally on a system by setting MANPAGER or
# WHATISPAGER:
#
# MANPAGER	/usr/bin/less -s
# WHATISPAGER	/usr/bin/more -E
#
# The output width can also be adjusted to either the literal value "tty" or a
# fixed column size, like so:
#
# MANWIDTH	120
#
# MANWIDTH=tty is the default setting if run in a terminal, which will instruct
# man(1) to detect the terminal size in columns and use that.
#
# Default manual sections (and order) to search if -S is not specified
# and the MANSECT environment variable is not set.

# Note: All of the following parameters have default values defined
#       in specifications, and hence you usually do not have to set them
#       by hand unless you need special non-default values.
#
#       You even do not need to create the configuration file.  rtadvd
#       would usually work well without a configuration file.
#       See also: rtadvd(8)

# per-interface definitions.
#   Mainly IPv6 prefixes are configured in this part.  However, rtadvd
#   automatically learns appropriate prefixes from the kernel's routing
#   table, and advertises the prefixes, so you don't have to configure
#   this part, either.
#   If you don't want the automatic advertisement, (uncomment and) configure
#   this part by hand, and then invoke rtadvd with the -s option.
